Sure, here's a README.md for your QR Code Generator:

# QR Code Generator

This Python application allows users to generate QR codes from input text. It provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built using the tkinter library.

## Features

- **Input Text**: Users can input any text into the provided text entry field.
- **QR Code Generation**: Upon clicking the "Submit" button or pressing the Enter key, the application generates a QR code representing the input text.
- **Dynamic Button State**: The "Submit" button is disabled when the text entry field is empty. It becomes enabled once the user inputs text.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Users can press the Enter key to submit the input text and generate the QR code. They can also use the shortcut Ctrl+A+Backspace to clear the input field.
- **Exit Button**: Provides an option to exit the application gracefully.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included in standard Python distributions)
- qrcode library
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

## Windows
```bash
pip install qrcode pillow
```

## Linux & Mac
```bash
pip3 install pillow qrcode
```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `qr_code_generator.py`.
2. Enter the text for which you want to generate the QR code into the provided text entry field.
3. Click the "Submit" button or press Enter.
4. The generated QR code will be displayed on the screen.

## How It Works

- The application takes user input from the text entry field.
- Upon submission, it generates a QR code using the qrcode library.
- The QR code is displayed on the GUI using tkinter's Label widget.
- The image is resized for better display.
- Keyboard events are handled to allow submission and text clearing shortcuts.
